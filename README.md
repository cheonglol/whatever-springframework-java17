# Journal (See timestamps through commits)

- creating an example of image service for the interns I have to take care of.
  - store images in `DB` as `VARBINARY`, or `BLOB`, or `ByteArr`
  - create endpoint to OutputStream the image.
  - add multithreading/queue/schedule or something. (i've no idea, this is my first time doing this too, my juniors are lucky.)
